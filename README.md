# Kodular_Exambro-android
## Project Objective
The school wants to create an Android-based exam system to be more efficient and paperless

## Problems
- There is no Android-based exam application yet
- The possibility of cheating during the exam is very large if the exam uses a mobile without an application

## Solution
- Create an Android-based exambro application using Kodular
  https://github.com/AchmadUzairi/Kodular_Exambro-android/blob/main/exambrowser.apk
- This exambro application will be connected to the school's learning website (LMS Moodle)
- This exambro application will lock the application if the user intentionally or accidentally closes or opens another application without permission

- This is the home screen of the exambro application
- The application will ask for the subject code to be tested
- After the code is filled in the application will forward the page to the exam page on the school's learning website (LMS Moodle)

- The exam is available, and test takers can take it

- This is what the application displays if an exam participant cheats
- The application will be locked and automatically exit, then it will sound "you cheated" so that the exam supervisor will immediately know

- This is the display if you want to leave the application
- If you press OK then the application will close properly and the test is complete
